# Network Meta-Analysis models
While network meta-analysis models may differ in their statistical approach, the good thing is that all should produce the same results when the sample size is sufficient. In general, no network meta-analysis method is more or less 
valid than the other. You may therefore safely choose one or the other approach, depending on which one you find more intuitive, or based on the functionality of the R package which implements it.
In most disciplines, methods based on frequentist inference are still much more common than Bayesian approaches. This means that some people might understand the kind of results produced by a frequentist model more easily. 

A disadvantage is that the implementation of frequentist network meta-analysis in R does not yet support meta-regression, while this is possible using a Bayesian model. 

In practice, a useful strategy is to choose one approach for the main analysis, and then employ the other approach in a sensitivity analysis. If the two methods come to the same conclusion, this increases our confidence that the
findings are trustworthy.

# Frequntist Network Meta-Analysis
Network Meta-Analysis using {netmeta}: It can not be stressed enough that clinical decision-making in network meta-analyses should not be based on one single test or metric. Instead, we have to explore our model and its results with
open eyes, check the patterns we find for their consistency, and take into account the large uncertainty that is often associated with some of the estimates.

# Bayesian Network Meta-Analysis
P(theta|Y) -> P(Y|theta)xP(theta), where P(theta) is the assumed prior distribution of theta, P(Y|theta) is the likelihood distribution, and P(theta|Y) is the posterior distribution. The posterior distribution represents our estimate
of theta if we take both the observed data and our prior knowledge into account.
Importantly, the posterior is still a distribution, not one estimated "true" value. This means that even the results of Bayesian inference are still probabilistic. They are also subjective, in the sense that they represent our beliefs
concerning the actual parameter values. Therefore, in Bayesian statistics, we do not calculate confidence intervals around our estimates, but credible intervals (CrI).

Another asset of Bayesian approaches is that the parameters do not have to follow a bell curve distribution. Other kinds of more complex distributions can also be modeled. A disadvantage of Bayesian inference, however, is that 
generating the (joint) distribution from our collected data can be very computationally expensive. 

Use {gemtc} package to perform the Bayesian network meta-analysis. (install jags and rjags packages first)

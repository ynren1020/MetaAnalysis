Inconsistency models vs consistency models in contrast based approach in network meta-analysis

In the context of network meta-analysis (NMA), the Consistency and Inconsistency models refer to different approaches used to evaluate and combine evidence across a 
network of studies. These models are particularly relevant in the "Contrast-Based" (CB) approach, which is a method of comparing the effects of different treatments 
using summary statistics like odds ratios, risk ratios, or mean differences.

1. Consistency Models
A Consistency model assumes that the direct and indirect evidence in the network are consistent with each other. In other words, it assumes that the treatment effects 
derived from different paths within the network are the same, regardless of whether they come from direct comparisons (e.g., treatment A vs. treatment B) or indirect
comparisons (e.g., treatment A vs. treatment C and treatment B vs. treatment C). 
  Assumption: The treatment effect is consistent across all paths in the network.
  Modeling Approach: In a consistency model, a single effect size is estimated for each treatment comparison, using all available evidence. The assumption is that if 
treatment A is better than treatment B and treatment B is better than treatment C, then treatment A should be better than treatment C by a consistent amount.
  Statistical Implications: This model is simpler and generally more powerful because it pools all available data under the assumption of consistency. However, if the consistency 
assumption is violated (i.e., if direct and indirect evidence differ significantly), the results may be misleading.

2. Inconsistency Models
An Inconsistency Model allows for the possibility that the direct and indirect evidence in the network might not be consistent. This model explicitly tests for and accounts for
differences between direct and indirect estimates of treatment effects.
  Assumption: There may be inconsistencies (differences) between direct and indirect comparisons within the network.
  Modeling Approach: In an inconsistency model, separate estimates are made for direct and indirect comparisons. The model checks if the differences between these estimates are 
statistically significant. If significant inconsistency is found, this suggests that the network's overall assumptions might not hold, and the pooled estimates might not be valid.
  Statistical implications: This model is more complex and less powerful because it requires more parameters to estimate. However, it provides a safeguard against the risk of drawing
incorrect conclusions from inconsistent evidence.

Key Differences and Usage:
  When to Use Consistency Models:
    When you have reason to believe that all studies included in the network meta-analysis are similar in terms of population, interventions, outcomes, and other factors. 
    When you want to maximize the statistical power by pooling all evidence under tha assumption that it is consistent.
  When to Use Inconsistency Models:
    When there is heterogeneity across studies or when previous analyses or domain expertise suggest that direct and indirect evidence might differ.
    When you need to explicitly test the consistency assumption to ensure robustness of your conclusions. 

Practical Application in NMA:
  Evaluating Inconsistency: In practice, an NMA might start with a consistency model and then test for inconsistency by comparing the fit of the consistency model to that of an 
inconsistency model. If significant inconsistency model is found, it might be necessary to explore the reasons behind it (e.g., through subgroup analysis, meta-regression, or 
sensitivity analysis).
  Software Implementation: Most NMA software, such as netmeta in R, offers tools to fit both consistency and inconsistency models. These tools also provide diagnostics (like 
inconsistency plots and node-splitting methods) to help assess whether the consistency assumption holds.

In summary, consistency models assume harmony across all evidence in the network, while inconsistency models allow for potential discordance, helping to ensure the robustness and 
validity of the meta-analysis conclusions.

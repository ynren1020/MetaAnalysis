In meta-analysis, I^2 is a statistic that quantifies the percentage of variation across studies that is due to heterogeneity rather than chance.
It is an important measure for assessing the consistency of the results across different studies included in the meta-analysis.

Range of I^2 (0%-100%):
0% I^2: This indicates that there is no observed heterogeneity, meaning all variability between study results is due to sampling error (chance). 
The studies are considered to be homogeneous.
100% I^2: This suggests that all observed variability is due to heterogeneity and not due to chance, indicating a high level of inconsistency 
among the studies.

While there are no strict cutoffs, the following thresholds are commonly used for interpreting I^2:
0-25%: Low heterogeneity
25-50%: Moderate heterogeneity
50-75%: Substantial heterogeneity
75-100%: Considerable heterogeneity

The interpretation of I^2 should also consider the context of the research, including the number of studies included, the sizes of the studies, and 
the domain of research. In some fields, a higher I^2 might be expected due to the nature of the interventions or outcomes being studied.

Moreover, even with a high I^2, a meta-analysis can still provide valuable insights, especially if the heterogeneity can be explained by subgroups, 
meta-regression, or sensitivity analyses.

step-by-step calculation:
1. calculate the total variance (Q)
Q is the Cochran's heterogeneity statistic, which is calculated using: Q = sum[wi(Yi-Ybar)^2] (sum all k studies)
wi is the weight assigned to each study, often based on the inverse of the variance(e.g., 1/Var(Yi)).
Yi is the effect size estimate of the ith study
Ybar is the weighted average effect size across all studies
Q assesses whether the observed difference in effect sizes across studies are greater than what would be expected by chance. High Q value indicates substantial 
heterogeneity across the studies, suggesting that the variation in effect sizes is more than would be expected by chance. Low Q value suggests that the studies 
are homogeneous, with little evidence of heterogeneity.

2. calculate the degrees of freedom
df = k - 1 where k is the number of studies 
3. Calculate the expected variance (Qdf)
Under the null hypothesis of homogeneity (i.e., all studies estimate the same effect size), Q follows a chi-square distribution with df degrees of freedom. 
The expected value of Q under homogeneity is equal to the degrees of freedom:
E(Q) = df = k-1
4. calculate the excess variance (H^2)
The excess variance is given by: H^2 = Q/df
5. Calculate I^2:
Finally, the I^2 statistic is calculated using I^2 = (Q-df)/Q * 100%
This formula calculates the proportion of total variation (Q) that is due to heterogeneity rather than chance.

When calculating I^2 in meta-analysis, it is possible for the Q statistic to be smaller than the degrees of freedom, resulting in a negative value for I^2. The common
and widely accepted approach when I^2 is negative is to set I^2 to 0%. A negative I^2 essentially suggests that the observed variation among the studies is less than
what would be expected by chance alone, which indicates no real heterogeneity. Thus, setting I^2 to 0% is appropriate because it aligns with the interpretation of no heterogeneity.

Why does this happen (I^2 is negative)?
- small number of studies: when the meta-analysis includes only a few studies, Q may not accurately reflect true heterogeneity due to limited power. This can sometimes lead to Q being
smaller than expected, resulting in a negative I^2.
- small study variability: if the studies included in the meta-analysis have very similar effect sizes and variances, Q may be small, reflecting little between-study variability.
